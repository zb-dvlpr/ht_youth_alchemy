## Versioning
- Follow SemVer: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
- Increment the version on every change, including documentation or configuration edits.
- Decide the bump based on scope: PATCH for bugfixes or tiny changes, MINOR for small new features, MAJOR for big new features or paradigm shifts, or the user requests a specific bump.
- Apply the version bump automatically; do not request confirmation.

## Documentation
- Update `README.md` whenever a feature is introduced, modified, or removed.
